# Plot.ly Challenge

## Description
In this project challenge, I have built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Installation and Deployment
1. `conda install -c conda-forge nodejs`

## D3 Visualizaton
A basic HTML page was created, showing the data that was extracted, and presented in table form.

## Technology
`JavaScript`
`HTML`
`JSON`

## Development Notes
I reviewed the dataset saved as
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Resources
1. Future implementation resources

Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard. An example dashboard is shown below:

## Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional)

The following task is advanced and therefore optional.

* Adapt the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

* You will need to modify the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 through 9.

* Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected.

## Deployment

* Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo.

* Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file

## Hints

* Use `console.log` inside of your JavaScript code to see what your data looks like at each step.

* Refer to the [Plotly.js documentation](https://plot.ly/javascript/) when building the plots.
